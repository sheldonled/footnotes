                    Foot Notes is a piece of Javascript (jQuery) HTML and CSS code,
                    that give links a good feature that, when you <a href='#fn:1' rel='ftnote'>click on</a>
                    it shows up a box with featured information about the link.
                    It is a plus for User Experience and makes your site more beauty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development of this tool ocurred this way:
                    <a href='#fn:2' rel='ftnote'>Sheldon Led</a> saw this feature in
                    <a href='#fn:3' rel='ftnote'>Zeno Rocha's website</a> and liked it.
                    So he got the code and adapted for his own <a target="_blank" href='http://sheldonled.com'>website</a>.
                    After this he put the code on <a href="https://github.com/sheldonled/footnotes">github</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you have to do is set up the Javascript and CSS code, so when you want a foot note link,
                    just put &lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='ftnote'&gt; tag on your link. The 1 is a counting of 
                    references, starting with 1 to N references. So down in your HTML document, put a div with
                    "footnotes" class, an then an &lt;ol&gt; list. You can see the HTML code of this page,
                    to understand.
